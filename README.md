## What is OpenFastTrace AsciiDoc Plugin?

This plugin allows OpenFastTrace (OFT) to parse and trace requirements in AsciiDoc files. Requirement tracing keeps track of whether you implemented everything you planned to in your specifications. It also identifies obsolete parts of your product and helps you to get rid of them.

For more details about requirement tracing and how to use OpenFastTrace, refer to the [user guide](doc/user_guide.md).

## What is AsciiDoc?

[AsciiDoc](https://asciidoc.org/) is a human-readable document format, semantically equivalent to DocBook XML, but using plain-text mark-up conventions. AsciiDoc documents can be created using any text editor and can be viewed and edited in source form without requiring additional tools.

AsciiDoc is highly configurable: both the AsciiDoc source file syntax and the backend output markups (which can be almost any type of SGML/XML markup) can be customized and extended by the user.

## How does AsciiDoc fit into OFT?

In the context of OpenFastTrace (OFT), AsciiDoc files can be used to write the software requirements specification. The AsciiDoc format allows for requirement IDs to be embedded in the text, which can then be traced by OFT.

Using the AsciiDoc Plugin, OFT is able to read and parse AsciiDoc files, trace the requirements mentioned in the files, and generate a requirement tracing report. This allows for easy tracking of the implementation status of each requirement directly from the specification document.
